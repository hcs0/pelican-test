# Testing out Pelican for static site generator

Create a Github User page via 'Settings' in the repo. Since I already have my own Github Userpage at superuser-ltd.github.io this page will be available there.

Go through the motions of downloading and setting up Pelican. See http://docs.getpelican.com

Install ghp-import https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import

The Pelican project folder will generate an output folder containing the HTML etc output files. Use ghp-import on the same directory to publish to Github page.
